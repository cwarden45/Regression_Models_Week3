# Regression_Models_Week3
Uploaded File for Coursera Course

As I point out on my [Google Sites page](https://sites.google.com/site/cwarden45/about-me), I am taking the Coursera "Regression Models" course.

There is an optional assignment in Week 3, which requries you to upload a file to a public GitHub Repository.  So, that is what I am doing with this repository.
